# LexieProgrammable
A programming font for dyslexia (under development) 

This is a programming font I developed for myself. I used Lexie Readable [ https://www.k-type.com/fonts/lexie-readable/ ] as the base and make alterations to take into account programming readability. 

The font is only optimized for myself, and I am exploring if others would find this font useful, and/or if they can give feedback that would make this font useful to them. 

Please post an Issue if you have any feedback.
