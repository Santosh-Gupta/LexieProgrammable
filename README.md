# Lexie Programmable
A programming font for those dyslexia (under development) 

This is a programming font I developed for myself, and is based on Lexie Readable [ https://www.k-type.com/lexie-readable/ ] 

The font is only optimized for myself, and I am exploring if others would find this font useful, and/or if they can give feedback that would make this font useful to them. 

Please post an Issue if you have any feedback. 

UPDATE:

I have recieved a lot of great feedback here

https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/d49ra3/lexie_programmable_i_made_a_programming_font_for/
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/d49gvs/lexie_programmable_i_made_a_programming_font_for/

However, due to licencing issues, I can not distribute the font to others. I am hoping to create a new dyslexic font based on Andika [ https://software.sil.org/andika/ ] whose open font licence allows for distribution. I think Andika is a fantastic candidate, and I am exciting for this project, but due to other ongoing projects, I won't be able to start anytime soon.
